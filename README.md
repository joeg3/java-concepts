# java-concepts
A project where I learn/practice Java concepts

#### Run the tests
- From command line: `./gradlew build `
- From IntelliJ: Create a run configuration for the `test` folder by right-clicking on it and selecting `Run tests in ...`

Notes:
- For `System.out.println("Hello");`, `System.out` is an object; an instance of the `PrintStream` class. The `PrintStream` class has methods `println()` , `print()`, etc.
